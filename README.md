# **Bret's GitHub Website**

## Lab Questions:
### 1. What are key functions of GitHub? Who are the users? Please us your own words to describe them (200 words - 300 words).
GitHub is an essential tool in the world of software. I have not had to use it yet since its main function is connecting a team together. GitHub is great for projects where people need to come together and create software. For the layman, I would describe GitHub as the coders Google Docs. 

Within GitHub you are able to do all of the following:

- Create projects with a team
- Edit that project with proper documentation of who made each edit
- Create _branches_ that allow people to work on a copy of the project. This keeps the _Main_ intact until the update is ready to be included.
- Pull Requests allow team members to share edits and updates with other members before the code is used in the _Main Branch_

GitHub is also a community itself. You are able to communicate and share code with users all around the world. This sort of community allows each user to  better their skills and continue their personal growth and development. 

One other great use of GitHub is using their website builder. GitHub allows its users to be able to create a website using Markdown Language. As I continue to use GitHub and gain more experience with Markdown Language I will be able to make a website that has better aesthetics.

As you can see there are a lot of great functions to using GitHub and as I am just a beginner myself, I am sure there are many more functions that can be used when working with a team. I am excited to finally start my journey in GitHub as I have seen it everywhere, but I haven't used it yet.

### 2. What are the differences between "clone" and "pull request" in GitHub?
Although these commands are similar they are used very differently. Clone is used to copy an entire repository while a pull request is updating your machine with what any updates that have been made in GitHub. 

### 3. Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its URL and describe its potential applications and values.
For my dataset I went to Kaggle and found a dataset interesting to me about NFL Quarterbacks.
[(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadraco/nfl-quarterback-index)]

This data set has 51 columns and 292 rows. It only goes back to 2000 which doesn't provide as much data as if we went back throughout the entire NFL. However, I believe that this is a good starting point to use since passing changed drastically in the early 2000's. DATADRACO,the author of the dataset told us what the purpose of the dataset was for.
> Originally created in an attempt to train a neural network that predicts NFL success level of a quarterback at the time of being drafted.

I can think of a few other purposes for this dataset. The original goal was for teams to be able to predict. However, I think we can use the dataset to describe. I think there is enough data to be able to see how well teams have drafted over this span and how well colleges do at getting QBs ready for the NFL. 

### 4. Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.
Looking through the lists I chose _Introduction to Machine Learning_ by Alex Smola and S.V.N. Vishwanathan.
[(https://alex.smola.org/drafts/thebook.pdf)]

I chose this book because _Machine Learning_ is currently out of my scope of knowledge, but I see it as a checkpoint in my career. All data scientists should thrive to understand and utilize machine learning tools. Of course it is not an end goal for me to understand this book, but personally I will have a great feeling of accomplishment after being able to use machine learning tools. 

This book is listed intermediate, but is still an introduction to machine learning. Like many topics, there is a base knowledge and then the deeper knowledge and understanding of that subject. I enjoy a challenge and see that this book isn't for beginners and that intrests me even more.
